                            This thesis proposal discusses considerations of foreign language learning related to using World of Warcraft to effectively develop competency in a foreign language. The proposal relies on a strategy developed by language learning expert and former opera singer Gabriel Wyner and specific in-game tools designed for language learning in World of Warcraft. It briefly covers foreign language learning strategy as that concept relates to “good” language learners, Wyner’s method of language study, and language study in general in the environment of a Massively-Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game such as World of Warcraft. It also lays out a strategy for the study that will make up the substantive part of the paper. This study will involve building and testing the previously-mentioned tools to facilitate carrying out Wyner’s language learning strategy in an effort to improve competence in a foreign language via World of Warcraft. For the purposes of this study, the chosen foreign language will be Latin-American Spanish, but the tools will be developed to be adaptable at a future date to the learner’s language of choice among the languages in which World of Warcraft is localized.
