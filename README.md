This is a personal/professional website.

It has some deficiencies:
CarbonType font on the index page was not rendering correctly in Firefox.
This resolves correctly in Firefox 62. Update Firefox to resolve the issue.
Preloading also fixes this.

There is a flash when the custom fonts load. This needs to be fixed. Attempt waiting to display the page until the fonts load, since the fonts load quickly. Font-display has not worked properly so far.

The site isn't responsive below 1024x768.
It needs tablet and mobile versions as well as a better form of scaling to large screens. The current method is okay, but could be better with margins/columns.
